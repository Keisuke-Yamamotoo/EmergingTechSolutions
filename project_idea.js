Title: Blockchain-based Digital Identity Management System

Description:
In today's digital world, the need for a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof digital identity management system is crucial. This project aims to develop a Blockchain-based Digital Identity Management System using JavaScript.

Features:
1. User Registration: Users can register with their personal details and obtain a unique digital identity.
2. Identity Verification: The system will verify user identities using a combination of government-issued IDs, biometric data, and attestation from trusted entities.
3. Data Privacy: Users will have control over their personal information and can choose which data to share with third parties.
4. Immutable Audit Trail: All identity-related transactions and verifications will be recorded on the Blockchain, ensuring transparency and eliminating fraud.
5. Multi-factor Authentication: The system will support multi-factor authentication methods, such as passwords, biometrics, and hardware tokens, to ensure secure access to user identities.

Tech Stack:
- JavaScript for backend development.
- Ethereum Blockchain for storing identity-related data.
- Solidity for writing smart contracts.
- Web3.js for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain.
- Express.js for building the API endpoints.
- MongoDB for storing non-sensitive user data.

Benefits:
- Enhanced security: Blockchain technology ensures data integrity and immutability.
- Improved privacy: Users have control over their personal data, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- Digital sovereignty: Users have ownership and control over their digital identities.
- Streamlined identity verification: Third parties can easily verify the authenticity of user identities.
- Efficient interoperability: The system can integrate with existing identity verification systems.

Next Steps:
1. Design the system architecture and database schema.
2. Develop the backend API endpoints for user registration, identity verification, and data sharing.
3. Implement smart contracts for storing identity-related data on the Ethereum Blockchain.
4. Build frontend interfaces for user registration and data sharing.
5. Conduct thorough testing and security audits.
6. Document the project and create a step-by-step guide for deployment.
